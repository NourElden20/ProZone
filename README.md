# ProZone
ProZone is a minimalistic and scalable e-commerce platform built using ASP.NET Core MVC and Razor Pages. It provides a clean user interface with authentication, cart functionality, and order management features. Designed for flexibility, ProZone supports user roles, profile management, and dynamic content rendering with ViewBags and partials.

⚙️ Note: The current codebase is in its pre-maintainability stage. While it covers core functionalities and a working UI, some practices (like layout structure, modularity, and reusable components) are still being refined to align with long-term maintainability and clean architecture principles.
